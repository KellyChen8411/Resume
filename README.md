# About me
<hr>
I describe myself as being brave to try new thing. Besides my own major, I have also conducted research in Nuclear Engineering, Mechanism Design and Image Processing. Due to the enthusiasm for getting along with people, I devoted myself into international activities. They not only built my language, communication and presentation skill but also let me know how to embrace different culture and value objectively.

**Server Thermal Engineer**

*Wistron Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan*  *2020/08-now*
-	Design thermal solution for server
-	In charge of two product: be able to arrange and handle schedule and communicate with other function team and customer
-	Develop automation tool for department

# Software Project Experience
<hr>

**Image Processing (language: Matlab)**
1.	Algorithm for centroid locate
  - Develop an algorithm which can automatically detect centroids of disk material on image (500 material per image). For each experiment data (about 60 images to process), user can save about 20 hours
2.	High Dynamic Range Imaging
3.	Image Stitching by using SIFT algorithm

**Automation tool (language: Excel VBA)**
1. Tool for log thermal test data automatically
  - With pressing a button, excel will calculate average value form thermal test raw data and then import values into test report automatically. For each thermal test, engineer can save about 20 minutes on processing data.
