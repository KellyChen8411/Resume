# About me
I describe myself as being brave to try new thing. Besides my own major, I have also conducted research in Nuclear Engineering, Mechanism Design and Image Processing. Due to the enthusiasm for getting along with people, I devoted myself into international activities. They not only built my language, communication and presentation skill but also let me know how to embrace different culture and value objectively.
